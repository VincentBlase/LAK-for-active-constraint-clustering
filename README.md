## Name
Adaptive Local Kernel for Efficient Active Pairwise Constraint Clustering

## Description
We introduce a novel active pairwise constraint clustering approach that employs a locally adaptive kernel, automat-ically adjusting its bandwidth based on local data density. This local adaptation identifies regions that deviate from uniform or Gaussian assumptions, prioritizing them for constraint queries and thus minimizing user effort while improving clustering quality.





## Installation
We recommand to download files on python 3.10.4 (Should work with other versions)

## Usage
Active clustering with pairwise constraint
